# Traveler's Weather Dash

This is a responsive application designed to use the OpenWeather API to load a weather dashboard displaying current conditions as well as a five-day forecast for any city the user searches for. Weather conditions are called from the API for each city including the temperature, humidity, wind speed , and the UV index, whose severity is indicated by color.  Searched cities are stored in client-side storage and added to the dropdown menu for the user to access at will.
